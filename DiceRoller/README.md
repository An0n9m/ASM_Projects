Dice Roller Application

Overview

The Dice Roller is a simple AVR microcontroller-based application written in assembly language. It simulates the roll of a dice, generating random numbers between 1 and 6. The application provides an interactive and educational example for learning assembly programming and microcontroller-based design.

Features

Generates random numbers between 1 and 6.

Simulates a real dice roll using a microcontroller.

Compatible with Atmel Studio for compilation.

Can be emulated in Proteus to visualize the design and functionality.

Requirements

Atmel Studio: Use Atmel Studio to write, compile, and debug the assembly code.

Proteus: Emulate the application and visualize the hardware behavior.

How to Use

Open the provided assembly code in Atmel Studio.

Compile the code to generate the hex file.

Open Proteus and design the circuit for the Dice Roller (refer to the picture placeholder below).

Load the compiled hex file into the microcontroller in Proteus.

Run the simulation to see the dice roller in action.
